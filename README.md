## Issues

### Viewer

#### Storing users manually

There is no way to hook Clerk and your Grafbase backend to automatically insert users on sign up, so you must hack it, and
create them manually on the login callback from clerk

#### Query your user

There is no way to query or store the user by certain prop, example, clerkId or username, or email, so I have to query
all the users and find the one that matches (email or username) client-side.

#### No createdAt/updatedAt

I have to manually store the ms in which the user was created.
