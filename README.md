## Missing
-[ ] Explanation steps and how it works.
-[ ] Pagination of items, users and posts.
-[ ] Better typing by using fragments and remove the NonNullable thing.
-[ ] Uncomment delete (It brokes the app, as it also deletes the linked users).
-[ ] About page.

## Issues

### General

#### Auth, no way to have both, anonymous and authenticated

I want the page to be fully visible to anonymous visitors but I can't with the current auth, as it is one or the other.


#### Auth, entities cannot be restricted to their owner

Any entity can be deleted by anyone once they access to it. Roles which are defined on Clerk cannot be automated. You must
assign them manually.

#### Deletion

As all links inside an entity get deleted when using a delete mutation, you cannot delete anything without also deleting the linked user.

### Viewer

#### Storing users manually

There is no way to hook Clerk and your Grafbase backend to automatically insert users on sign up, so you must hack it, and
create them manually on the login callback from Clerk.

#### Query your user

There is no way to query or store the user by certain prop, example, clerkId or username, or email, so I have to query
all the users and find the one that matches (email or username) client-side to hydrate the viewer.

#### No createdAt/updatedAt

I have to manually store the ms in which the user was created.

### Posts

#### No ordering by certain field (votes)
...

#### Not able to increment, decrement or aggregates on votes count
...

#### How to tell if a user has already voted a post?

I should be able to query Votes entity by postId and userId

### Bugs

#### Update mutation doesn't work a second time

Seems like update mutation only works once, you can check it out by upvoting/downvoting posts.
